    "# ðŸš€ Step-by-Step Guide to Train a Churn Prediction Model\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will guide you through training a churn prediction model using customer data. We will prepare the data, train a classification model, evaluate it, and save the model for later use.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Import Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "Import necessary Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and joblib.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2: Load and Explore Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Load your cleaned and encoded dataset, perform basic exploration to understand the data structure and target distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 3: Prepare Features and Target Variable\n",
    "\n",
    "Separate the dataset into feature variables (`X`) and the target variable (`y`), which is the churn flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 4: Split Data into Training and Testing Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "Use `train_test_split` to create training and testing datasets, typically 70-80% for training and 20-30% for testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 5: Choose and Train the Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Select a classification algorithm: Logistic Regression and train it on the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 6: Evaluate Model Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluate the model on the test set using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 7: Save the Trained Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Save the trained model using `joblib` or `pickle` for deployment or integration in the Streamlit app.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 8: Conclusion and Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Summarize findings and discuss how the model can be used for real-time churn prediction and customer retention strategies.\n",
